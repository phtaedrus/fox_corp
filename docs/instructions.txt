"""Create the following resources using Terraform:

·         An S3 bucket

·         An IAM role

·         An IAM policy attached to the role that allows it to perform any
            S3 actions on that bucket and the objects in it

·         An EC2 instance with the IAM role attached

·         Output the public IP of the EC2 instance and the S3 bucket name.

--Create a README.md and document all assumptions you’ve made. Login to the EC2 instance and
--validate that you’re able to access the bucket using the role."""
